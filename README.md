# Pangolin Scripts

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of commonly used scripts for maintaining a DEX like Pangolin. Most scripts are 
internally configuration driven to help avoid errors but there is always a risk especially when mis-configuring 
something. Some directories are driven by one higher level configuration file like `single_side_staking` to ensure the 
same information is used across multiple steps. Overall, the repo is meant to be tweaked as needed by devs and to hold 
the hands of users with light+ technical experience.

### `/src/core/`
This directory contains some core logic (think library) used to support other scripts in the repo. 
You shouldn't need to play around in here.

### `/src/fee_collector/`
This directory contains scripts to interact with FeeCollector, the contract tasked with custody and management of 
Pangolin's accumulated swap fees. The most commonly done tasks is permissionlessly initiating a PNG buyback to fund 
the PNG staking program.

### `/src/governance/`
This directory contains scripts to interact with GovernorAlpha, the primary onchain governance mechanism for Pangolin. 
Notable functionality includes submitting a proposal, voting on a proposal, and executing a proposal.

### `/src/minichef/`
This directory contains scripts to interact with MiniChefV2, the contract driving Pangolin's primary system of 
incentivizing liquidity providers aka "farming." Notable functionality includes adding farms and changing weights.

### `/src/multisig/`
This directory contains scripts to interact with different versions of DAOs commonly referred to as multi-signature 
wallets. Support is included for interacting with the gnosis multisig and gnosis safe. Notable functionality includes 
submitting transactions, confirming transactions, and executing transactions.

### `/src/single_side_staking/`
This directory contains scripts to interact with single side staking contracts. These are the contracts that power 
Pangolin's PNG staking programs. Support is included for different tasks to be done via a multisig or EOA. Notable 
functionality includes setting a program duration period, ownership management, and kicking off a staking program.

### `/src/util/`
This directory contains a collection of scripts aimed at understanding on-chain data better. Many of these scripts 
provide a GUI for related information. Notable functionality includes an overview of all the farms, single side 
staking expirations, and verification of tokenlist updates.

### `/python`
This directory contains all scripts wrote in python.

### Other
The vesting bot used by Pangolin also lives here. It ensures that PNG is vested appropriately each day so that PNG 
farming rewards continue to flow.
